  House Price Prediction
Developed a Machine Learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and amenities. Implemented data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. Applied regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluated performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score. Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify key price-driving factors.
